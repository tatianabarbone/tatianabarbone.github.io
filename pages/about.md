# **About Me**

Hi! I'm **{{ site.author.name }}**.

Currently, I'm a student at the University of San Diego studying Computer Science.

Last summer I worked as a Digital/IT Intern at Dell Technologies on the Connectivity/IoT team, where I analyzed and visualized aggregated log data in the connectivity space to create beautiful, useful, and concise data visualizations using [pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/) and [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/).

I'm currently working on learning [SQL](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/).

Some of my hobbies include photography, graphic design and running.
